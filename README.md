# Quadratic equation generator

The generated equations are output as in two pdf's, one with problems and the other with the accompanying solutions.

The number of equations to be generated can be set for each of the three levels of difficulty.

Students names can be included in the pdf's. This is important as each sheet of problems is unique.

The main advantage is that eachs student has their own set of unique problems. This inhibits the copying of answers from one student to another.
