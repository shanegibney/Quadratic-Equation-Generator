# Quadratic equation generator

* The generated equations are output as in two pdf's, one with problems and the other with the accompanying solutions.

* The number of equations to be generated can be set for each of the three levels of difficulty.

* Students names can be included in the pdf's. This is important as each sheet of problems is unique.

* The main advantage is that eachs student has their own set of unique problems. This inhibits the copying of answers from one student to another.

* This code is running on the Github project page
